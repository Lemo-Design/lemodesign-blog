In today's rapidly evolving landscape, frameworks like React.js and Angular have gained significant popularity due to their functionality and efficiency in application development. Businesses often face a dilemma when selecting the most suitable tool for building applications, websites, and landing pages. To assist you in making an informed decision, Lemo-Design has prepared a concise guide that highlights the key differences between these two options.

| Distinction          | Angular                                                                                                                                                                                    | React                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Full-featured Framework – Provides a comprehensive opinion on application design along with several small libraries to support the development of complex applications. | UI Library – Focused solely on UI components, React offers more flexibility in code organization with the option to implement Flux for MVC design. |
| Data binding         | Supports both one-way and two-way data binding. Two-way data binding allows changes in UI inputs to reflect in the model state, and vice versa.	                                    | One-way data binding restricts UI elements from directly affecting a component's state.                                                                                       |
| Language             | TypeScript – A statically typed language that extends JavaScript.                                                                                                                | JavaScript with the ability to write JSX (JavaScript XML) using TypeScript as an optional inclusion.                                                                                    |
| UI Components        | Material Design Components – Angular includes a collection of material design components, simplifying UI configuration.                                                                 | Material-UI Library & Dependencies – React benefits from community-developed UI tools offering a wide range of UI components.                                                             |
| Dependency Injection | Supports dependency injection, enabling separate life cycles for different stores.                                                                                                 | React does not provide full support for dependency injection, as each component maintains its own global state.                                                                    |
| DOM                  | Incremental DOM – Compares a newly created DOM with the previous one and applies differences to the actual DOM, allocating memory only when necessary.                      | Virtual DOM – Creates a new virtual DOM whenever the actual DOM changes, compares it with the previous one, and updates only the modified differences.          |

## Headless WordPress

It's worth mentioning that "headless WordPress" can be a powerful solution when your business relies on WordPress for generating and publishing marketing content. This approach involves using WordPress as the central content management system while leveraging frameworks like ReactJS or Angular to publish the content across the web. By going headless, you benefit from the flexibility of these robust frameworks while enabling marketing teams to continue using WordPress as their familiar tool for content creation and publication.

In the current times, frameworks like React.js and Angular are gaining more populair for their functionality and efficiency for application development. Businesses can often feel conflicted when deciding which tool is better for developing applications and other content like websites and landing pages. To help you make an informed choice, we at Lemo-Design have created a simple guide to show the contrast between the two the different options.

| Distinction          | Angular                                                                                                                                                                                    | React                                                                                                                                                                |

| Purpose              | Full-featured Framework – provides a strong opinion on how your application should be designed, as well as a number of tiny libraries that aid in the development of complex applications. | The library is only concerned with UI components. MVC design requires Flux to implement, but it provides you more flexibility in how you wish to organise your code. |
| Data binding         | Supports both one way and two way data binding ,two-way data binding means that if we modify the UI input, the model state will change, and vice versa.                                    | One-way data binding means that a UI element can’t affect a component’s state.                                                                                       |
| Language             | TypeScript is a statically typed language that is a superset of JavaScript.                                                                                                                | TypeScript can write JavaScript XML (JSX), although it isn’t included by default.                                                                                    |
| UI Components        | Material Design Components – Angular includes a number of material design components that make UI configuration a breeze.                                                                  | Material-UI Library & Dependencies – Community-developed UI tools provide a wide range of UI components.                                                             |
| Dependency Injection | Dependency injection is supported, allowing for separate life cycles for different stores.                                                                                                 | React does not fully enable dependency injection because each component has its own global state.                                                                    |
| DOM                  | Incremental DOM – when a new DOM is created, it compares it to the previous one and applies the differences to the “actual” DOM, only allocating memory if necessary.                      | Virtual DOM – anytime the DOM changes, a new virtual DOM is created, compared to the previous one, and only the differences are modified in the “real” DOM.          |

## Headless WordPress

There is also something worth mentioning that is often a powerful tool when people inside your business are using WordPress and want to keep this as their main tool to generate and publish marketing content. The solution to this would be to go "headless" this is a a way use WordPress as the main location to manage your content, and using famrworks like ReactJS or Angular to publish them accross the web. This way you get the best of both worlds. The flexibility of these prowerful frameworks. And the efficiency to publish so marketing teams are not required to learn new tools and can keep using WordPress for this.
